# Stream mining project
A repo for data stream mining project (M2 D&amp;K).

In this project, we implement the weighted ensemble classifier and its extension 
for cost-sensitive applications as described in [1].

## Team members
- Armita KHAJEHNASSIRI
- Soumeya KAADA
- Minh Huong LE NGUYEN

## Source code
- `ensemble.py` contains the implementation of Weighted Ensemble Classifier, 
as described in Algorithm 1 in [1].
- `costsensiv_ensemble.py` contains the implementation of Cost-Sensitive Weighted Ensemble Classifier, 
as described in Algorithm 2 and 3 in [1].
